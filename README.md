# ykfde
YubiKey Full Disk Encryption

(yubikey support for LUKS)

## Quick start:

First install the package, then do something like the following (with your
yubikey plugged in!)

    # ykfdectl new

On bootup, you will be asked to insert a yubikey (2.2 or newer) which
will then provide the response.  If you do not want to use a yubikey,
press enter and then enter a normal passphrase during bootup.

## Change the key

    # ykfdectl update

## Changing the key on each reboot

This is still very basic.

    # update-rc.d ykfde defaults

## Configuration

See _/etc/default/ykfde_

Normaly used to select only the slot

* lacks a two-factor-mode
